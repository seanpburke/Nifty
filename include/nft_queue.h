 *
 * Synchronized FIFO and LIFO message queues for use in threaded applications.
 *
 * This package provides functions that enable threads to exchange messages.
 * You can set a limit on the number of items in the queue, and you can
 * shut down the queue gracefully when you wish to.
 *
 * The nft_queue_pop_wait() call is provided to enable a thread to block
 * while waiting for an item to be placed on the queue.
 *
 * The nft_queue_add_wait() call enables the thread to block for a limited time
 * when the queue is full. The blocked thread will complete if a pop operation
 * creates space to queue a new item before the timeout expires. There is also
 * a nft_queue_push_wait() call, to operate the queue in LIFO (stack) mode.
 *
 * These calls are cancellation-safe (but NOT async-cancel safe!) so you
 * can safely cancel a thread that is blocked in one of the _wait() calls.
